      <h3 class="subtitle">A Brief Story About Me</h3>
      <p>When I was studying for a language degree, I found myself inclining towards a life pursuit of problem solving.
        I
        had also started to dabble in online trading where I was convinced that a systematic approach was crucial to
        avoiding
        falling prey to the irrationalities of the markets. That has made me aspire to get into the world of
        quantitative finance as a software engineer, and hopefully becoming a quant trader. However, realising that I
        wasn't a good autodidact, I have
        come to Xccelerate for a more organised, reliable approach to learning software development.</p>

      <h3 class="subtitle">What Do I Expect to Get from the Bootcamp?</h3>
      <p>Given the speed of the technological changes we have witnessed recently, the best outcome from a bootcamp
        experience should be the ability of picking up any new knowledge according to the demands of the job. In other
        words, I am learning how to learn, which is exactly what I am shooting for; one is forced to adapt under
        pressure.</p>
